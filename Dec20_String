#1. Write a Python program to count the occurrences of each word in a given sentence string = “To change the overall look of your document.
#To change the look available in the gallery”

print("Word counts:")
for word,count in word_count.items():
    print(word ," = occur in ", count,"times")#printing word with count



#2.Write a Python program to remove a newline in Python String = "\nBest \nDeeptech \nPython \nTraining\n" 
string="\nBest \nDeeptech \nPython \nTraining \n"
string=string.replace('\n','')#replace newline with space

print("String without newline :",string)#printing string without newline
                      


#3.Write a Python program to reverse words in a string String = “Deeptech Python Training” 
string="Deeptech Python Training"
words=string.split()#split string into words

reversed_string=''.join(reversed(words))#reversing the list of words and join them back
print("Reversed string :",reversed_string)


#4.Write a Python program to count and display the vowels of a given text String=”Welcome to python Training”

string="Welcome to Python Training"
vowels="aeiou"
vowels_count=0

for char in string:
    if char.lower() in vowels:
        vowels_count+=1
