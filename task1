#1. Calculate the multiplication and sum of two numbers
#Enter a Two  number
number1=int(input("Enter the first number="))
number2=int(input("Enter the second number="))

#Calculate the Multiplication
multiplication=number1*number2

#Calculate the Summation
Summation=number1+number2

# Print the results
print("The multiplication of Two numbers is:",multiplication)
print("The sum of two numbers is: ",Summation)


#2. Declare two variables and print which variable is largest using ternary operator:

# variables declarations
a = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Use ternary operator to find the largest
largest = a if a > b else b

# Print the result
print("The largest number is:",largest)


#3. Convert temperature from degree centigrade to Fahrenheit
# Input temperature in Celsius
celsius = float(input("Enter temperature in Celsius: "))

# Convert to Fahrenheit
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32

# Print the result
print(celsius,"°C is equal to ",fahrenheit,"°F")



#4. Python program to find the area of a triangle whose sides are given in python  get the input from user

# Get the sides of the triangle from the user
a = float(input("Enter the length of the first side: "))
b = float(input("Enter the length of the second side: "))
c = float(input("Enter the length of the third side: "))

# Calculate the semi-perimeter
s = (a + b + c) / 2

# Calculate the area using Heron's formula
area = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5

# Print the area
print("The area of the triangle is:", area)
